This is a mini game for practicing English, specifically ESL (English as a second language). The content is clothing and clothing related vocabulary, with target phrases such as "he is wearing a hat" or "she is wearing a dress". The language is quite simple and so this game is really aimed at beginner level learners or young children. I tried to include some more unusual items, such as "mittens" and "baseball cap", but generally the language is very simple - "pants", "T-shirt", "shoes", "coat".
